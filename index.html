				<h4>Strategic Marketing Partnerships</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>CEOs want to know they’re getting every penny of value out of their investment in marketing.  Marketers want help measuring and managing the investment so they can focus on executing the plan.  We bring our many years of industry expertise to each client relationship in order to develop a dynamic and powerful marketing strategy that delivers a solid return on investments.</p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/arrow-large.png">
				<h4>Marketing Mentoring</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>We work one-on-one with marketing employees coaching them on the things they need to know to be successful.  Driven by their own goals and strengths, we support and encourage them in the areas on which they want to focus while helping the credit union realize increased productivity and results.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="shutter">
				<img src="img/arrow-large.png">
				<h4>Marketing Workshops</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>Marketing isn’t just one person or department in the credit union. Everyone in the credit union is a marketer, and we give everyone in the organization the skills to know how to live out their credit union’s vision every day with every member and every transaction.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="shutter">
				<img src="img/arrow-large.png">
				<h4>Marketing Assessments</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>We perform an extensive audit to make sure that all marketing efforts are solidly in line with the credit union’s overall objectives and goals, and draw on industry knowledge to suggest tactics and strategies to maximize the potential of the existing plan.  This is a great way for a credit union to get the outside perspective they need to ensure the marketing plan is the most relevant and best use of its budget.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="shutter">
				<img src="img/arrow-large.png">
				<h4>Mastermind Groups</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>These groups bring together the brightest and most talented credit union CEOS and marketers nationally on a monthly basis to work through specific challenges, learn from and encourage one another, and build a community of future leaders in the industry.  Mastermind groups are the coolest party in the credit union space.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="shutter">
				<img src="img/arrow-large.png">
				<h4>Strategic Planning Sessions</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>Drawing on our many years of industry experience, we share your credit union’s trends against industry and peer trends, ask challenging questions and align the management team around future organizational objectives.  Once the session is complete, we compile the outcomes and provide a formalized strategic plan document for the credit union.</p>

				<p><strong>I founded TwoScore because I love credit unions and believe small credit unions are vital to this industry.</strong> Working with a fantastic group of people throughout my credit union career helped me realize my dream of helping small credit unions thrive and stay relevant.</p>
				<p>In working for credit unions that range in size from $37 million to $200 million in assets, I learned first hand the unique challenges small credit unions face in today’s market.  TwoScore channels my passion for the credit union mission and the wonderful people in this industry to help credit unions  reach their strategic goals through marketing.</p>
				<p>I am extremely honored to be the recipient of many state and national awards, including the <em>Ohio Credit Union League Cutting Edge Marketing Brilliance Award</em>, <em>Trailblazer 40 Below</em>, Crash the <em>GAC</em>, Crash <em>Big.Bright.Minds</em>, and a finalist in the <em>2011 CUES Next Top Credit Union Exec</em> competition.</p>
				<p><strong>Why the name TwoScore?</strong> It was Matthew 14:22-33, the part where Jesus walks on water, that made my mission become clear.  Jesus asked Peter to have faith and not to doubt Him.  In reading further about the life of Peter, the word “forty” is used throughout the Bible as a symbol of faith, and I knew I wanted the name to reflect “40” in some way.  It was my awesome husband who eventually came up with TwoScore.  And I love it because it not only symbolizes this important meaning, but it also represents my love of music, history, and sports.</p>
				<p>When I’m not busy helping credit unions succeed, you can find me reading, watching Kentucky Wildcats basketball (<em>GO CATS!</em>), trying my hand at a new recipe, traveling, or planning our next trip.</p>
