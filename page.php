				<p><strong>I founded TwoScore because I love credit unions and believe small credit unions are vital to this industry.</strong> Working with a fantastic group of people throughout my credit union career helped me realize my dream of helping small credit unions thrive and stay relevant.</p>
				<p>In working for credit unions that range in size from $37 million to $200 million in assets, I learned first hand the unique challenges small credit unions face in today’s market.  TwoScore channels my passion for the credit union mission and the wonderful people in this industry to help credit unions  reach their strategic goals through marketing.</p>
				<p>I am extremely honored to be the recipient of many state and national awards, including the <em>Ohio Credit Union League Cutting Edge Marketing Brilliance Award</em>, <em>Trailblazer 40 Below</em>, Crash the <em>GAC</em>, Crash <em>Big.Bright.Minds</em>, and a finalist in the <em>2011 CUES Next Top Credit Union Exec</em> competition.</p>
				<p><strong>Why the name TwoScore?</strong> It was Matthew 14:22-33, the part where Jesus walks on water, that made my mission become clear.  Jesus asked Peter to have faith and not to doubt Him.  In reading further about the life of Peter, the word “forty” is used throughout the Bible as a symbol of faith, and I knew I wanted the name to reflect “40” in some way.  It was my awesome husband who eventually came up with TwoScore.  And I love it because it not only symbolizes this important meaning, but it also represents my love of music, history, and sports.</p>
				<p>When I’m not busy helping credit unions succeed, you can find me reading, watching Kentucky Wildcats basketball (<em>GO CATS!</em>), trying my hand at a new recipe, traveling, or planning our next trip.</p>
