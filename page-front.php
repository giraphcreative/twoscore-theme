				<h4>Strategic Marketing Partnerships</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>CEOs want to know they’re getting every penny of value out of their investment in marketing.  Marketers want help measuring and managing the investment so they can focus on executing the plan.  We bring our many years of industry expertise to each client relationship in order to develop a dynamic and powerful marketing strategy that delivers a solid return on investments.</p>

				<h4>Marketing Mentoring</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>We work one-on-one with marketing employees coaching them on the things they need to know to be successful.

				<h4>Marketing Workshops</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>Marketing isn’t just one person or department in the credit union. Everyone in the credit union is a marketer, and we give everyone in the organization the skills to know how to live out their credit union’s vision every day with every member and every transaction.</p>

				<h4>Marketing Assessments</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>We perform an extensive audit to make sure that all marketing efforts are solidly in line with the credit union’s overall objectives and goals, and draw on industry knowledge to suggest tactics and strategies to maximize the potential of the existing plan.  This is a great way for a credit union to get the outside perspective they need to ensure the marketing plan is the most relevant and best use of its budget.</p>

				<img src="<?php bloginfo( 'template_url' ) ?>/img/arrow-large.png">
				<h4>Mastermind Groups</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>These groups bring together the brightest and most talented credit union CEOS and marketers nationally on a monthly basis to work through specific challenges, learn from and encourage one another, and build a community of future leaders in the industry.

				<h4>Strategic Planning Sessions</h4>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>Drawing on our many years of industry experience, we share your credit union’s trends against industry and peer trends, ask challenging questions and align the management team around future organizational objectives.  Once the session is complete, we compile the outcomes and provide a formalized strategic plan document for the credit union.</p>
